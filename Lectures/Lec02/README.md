## PLC 3.2

Our regular expression solution for a regular expression which recognizes all sequences consisting of _a_ and _b_ where two _a_â€™s are always separated by at least one _b_, is "`^(b|ab|a$)+$`".

### DFA

| DFA | At A | At B | NFA-states |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---------- |
| S0  | S2   | S1   | {1,2,4}    |
| S1  | S2   | S1   | {3}        |
| S2  | X    | S1   | {5}        |

## BCD 2.1

Note: We were confused about the phrasing of the question, and asked a TA. For example, we were confused whether "All number-strings that have the value 42." meant any number that had "42" in it, such as 1230420123, or if it is any number that equals 42, such as 0000042. We were told the former was the correct understandig, and have done the exercises in such a manner.

### a)
`([0-9]*42[0-9]*)+`

### b)
`^(?!.*42.*)[0-9]+`

### c)
`0*([1-9][0-9]{2,}|4[3-9]|[5-9][0-9])`

## BCD 2.2

### a)
To make a NFA, we have divided the regular expression into 3 parts (a*, a|b and aa):
![](https://github.com/REXKrash/PRDAT2022/blob/main/Lectures/Lec02/images/BCD2_2/NFAv0.png?raw=true) 

We then make separate NFAs for each part:
#### NFA for _a*_

#### NFA for _a|b_
![](https://github.com/REXKrash/PRDAT2022/blob/main/Lectures/Lec02/images/BCD2_2/NFAv02.png?raw=true) 

#### NFA for _aa_
![](https://github.com/REXKrash/PRDAT2022/blob/main/Lectures/Lec02/images/BCD2_2/NFAv03.png?raw=true) 

Lastly, we will unify each separate NFA into 1 final NFA:

### b)
Through building this DFA, we have made the following matrix:

| DFA | At A | At B | NFA-states                        |
| --- | ---- | ---- | --------------------------------- |
| S0  | S1   | S4   | {1,2,4,5,6,8}                     |
| S1  | S2   | S4   | {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12}          |
| S2  | S3   | S4   | {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,13}       |
| S3  | S3   | S4   | {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,14,15} |
| S4  | S5   | X    | {9,10,11,12}                      |
| S5  | S6   | X    | {13}                              |
| S6  | X    | X    | {14,15}                           |


This translates into the following DFA:

## HelloLex exercises:

### Question 1:
What are the regular expressions involved, and
which semantic values are they associated with?

[0-9]

This is a single digit which is one of the natural numbers


### Question 2:
Which additional file is generated during the process?
hello.fs

How many states are there by the automaton of the lexer?
3 states


### Question 3:
Compile and run the generated program

![](https://github.com/REXKrash/PRDAT2022/blob/main/Lectures/Lec02/images/HelloLex/Question3.png?raw=true)

### Question 4:
Extend the lexer specification hello.fsl to
recognize numbers of more than one digit. New
lexer specification is hello2.fsl. Generate
hello2.fs, compile and run the generated program.

### Question 5:
Extend the lexer specification hello2.fsl to recognize floating
numbers. New lexer specification is hello3.fsl. Generate
hello3.fs, compile and run the generated program.
